My main programming language when I was studying was, as for many other developers, Java. There were other languages too, but Java was the main tool for learning basic software development. Later in my work I came in contact with C#, and since then I have come to prefer it over Java due to its features and ability to quickly evolve, and the extensive .NET API.

The basic aspect of C# is the object orientation which works similarly as in Java, although there are [subtle differences](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1882692/c-sharp-constructor-execution-order). However, what makes it a bit more exciting are other features such as dynamic, async/await and functional. The latter is something that has gained quite a lot of popularity, although [it's not a new paradigm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming#History). It was this aspect of C#, and in practice LINQ, that got me curious about functional programming in general. 

I decided to take a closer look at F#, partly because it's a member of the .NET platform but also because it seems to be developed from a pragmatic point of view. It is also very exciting that it is open source, seems to have a friendly community, and has support on several different platforms. Also noteworthy, at the time of writing F# has risen from position 45 to 16 in the [TIOBE index](http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html).

I am still very much a beginner, but in the spirit of recording things here are the resources I have used so far.

General
-------

 - [fsharp.org][5] - A hub for information about F# and the first place you should look.
 - [tryfsharp.org][6] - This site is amazing, it has a tutorial including an editor (with intellisense!) that works by using Silverlight to host the F# compiler in the browser.
 - [fsharpforfunandprofit.com][7] - A general site for learning F# that contains a lot of information in the form of tutorials and posts. 
 - [F# Language Reference][8] - F# on MSDN.
 - [Learn X in Y minutes, where X = F#][9] - To the point information about F# in the form of code examples.

Blogs
-----

These are blogs, related to F#, that I try to read as often as possible, in no particular order.

 - [Rachel Reese][10]
 - [Devjoy][11]
 - [Visual Studio F# Team][12]
 - [Tomas Petricek][13]
 - [Sergey Tihon][14]
 - [Michael Newton][15]
 - [Kit Eason][16]
 - [Don Syme][17]

Books
-----
There are several [book suggestions on fsharp.org][18], and the one I got and am reading is [Functional Programming using F#][19].

Videos
------
When I was at [Öredev][21] I attended a couple of sessions on F#.

<h3>F# for C# developers by Phil Trelford</h3>

Podcasts
--------
[The .NET Rocks][22] show has several shows where they talk about F#.

Practicing
----------
[Project Euler][23] is a good resource to use for practicing problem solving using programming. Other than that I have used F# to solve a problem that interested me, and there will be a separate blog post about it later. I will keep using F# wherever it feels like a good fit, because for me personally trying things out is what works best when learning something.

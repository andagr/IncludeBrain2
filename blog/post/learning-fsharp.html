                <p>My main programming language when I was studying was, as for many other developers, Java. There were other languages too, but Java was the main tool for learning basic software development. Later in my work I came in contact with C#, and since then I have come to prefer it over Java due to its features and ability to quickly evolve, and the extensive .NET API.</p>
<p>The basic aspect of C# is the object orientation which works similarly as in Java, although there are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1882692/c-sharp-constructor-execution-order">subtle differences</a>. However, what makes it a bit more exciting are other features such as dynamic, async/await and functional. The latter is something that has gained quite a lot of popularity, although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming#History">it's not a new paradigm</a>. It was this aspect of C#, and in practice LINQ, that got me curious about functional programming in general.</p>
<p>I decided to take a closer look at F#, partly because it's a member of the .NET platform but also because it seems to be developed from a pragmatic point of view. It is also very exciting that it is open source, seems to have a friendly community, and has support on several different platforms. Also noteworthy, at the time of writing F# has risen from position 45 to 16 in the <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">TIOBE index</a>.</p>

<p>I am still very much a beginner, but in the spirit of recording things here are the resources I have used so far.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://fsharp.org">fsharp.org</a> - A hub for information about F# and the first place you should look.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tryfsharp.org">tryfsharp.org</a> - This site is amazing, it has a tutorial including an editor (with intellisense!) that works by using Silverlight to host the F# compiler in the browser.</li>
<li><a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com">fsharpforfunandprofit.com</a> - A general site for learning F# that contains a lot of information in the form of tutorials and posts.</li>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233181.aspx">F# Language Reference</a> - F# on MSDN.</li>
<li><a href="http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/fsharp/">Learn X in Y minutes, where X = F#</a> - To the point information about F# in the form of code examples.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Blogs</h2>
<p>These are blogs, related to F#, that I try to read as often as possible, in no particular order.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>Books</h2>
<p>There are several <a href="http://fsharp.org/about/learning.html">book suggestions on fsharp.org</a>, and the one I got and am reading is <a href="http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/%7Emire/FSharpBook/">Functional Programming using F#</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/9781107684065_200_functional-programming-using-f_haftad.jpg" alt="Functional Programming using F#" /></p>
<h2>Videos</h2>
<p>When I was at <a href="http://oredev.org">Öredev</a> I attended a couple of sessions on F#.</p>
<h3>F# for C# developers by Phil Trelford</h3>

<h3>Discovering Type Providers in F# 3.0 by Rachel Reese</h3>
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/79402548" width="500" height="300" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h2>Podcasts</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/">The .NET Rocks</a> show has several shows where they talk about F#.</p>
<h2>Practicing</h2>
<p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> is a good resource to use for practicing problem solving using programming. Other than that I have used F# to solve a problem that interested me, and there will be a separate blog post about it later. I will keep using F# wherever it feels like a good fit, because for me personally trying things out is what works best when learning something.</p>
